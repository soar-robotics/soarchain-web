  'Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is a unified connectivity platform designed to offer vehicles low-latency vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-roadside infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication.',
  'Combining secure wide area and short-range connectivity in one module, C-V2X is a versatile and cost-effective solution for automakers looking to improve road safety.',
  'With the expanding usage of electronic sensors on vehicles and the amount of data generated, a reliable, secure communication system is necessary in mobility space.',
  'The direct communication between vehicles and other devices (V2V, V2I) uses the PC5 interface. PC5 refers to a reference point where the User Equipment (UE) directly communicates with another UE over the direct channel. In this case, the communication with the base station is not required. At the system architectural level, proximity service is the feature that specifies the architecture of the direct communication between UEs.',
